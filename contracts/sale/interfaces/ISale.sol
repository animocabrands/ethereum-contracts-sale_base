/**
 * @title ISale
 *
 * An interface for a contract which allows merchants to display products and customers to purchase them.
 *
 *  Products, designated as SKUs, are represented by bytes32 identifiers so that an identifier can carry an
 *  explicit name under the form of a fixed-length string. Each SKU can be priced via up to several payment
 *  tokens which can be ETH and/or ERC20(s). ETH token is represented by the magic value TOKEN_ETH, which means
 *  this value can be used as the 'token' argument of the purchase-related functions to indicate ETH payment.
 *
 *  The total available supply for a SKU is fixed at its creation. The magic value SUPPLY_UNLIMITED is used
 *  to represent a SKU with an infinite, never-decreasing supply. An optional purchase notifications receiver
 *  contract address can be set for a SKU at its creation: if the value is different from the zero address,
 *  the function `onPurchaseNotificationReceived` will be called on this address upon every purchase of the SKU.
 *
 *  This interface is designed to be consistent while managing a variety of implementation scenarios. It is
 *  also intended to be developer-friendly: all vital information is consistently deductible from the events
 *  (backend-oriented), as well as retrievable through calls to public functions (frontend-oriented).
